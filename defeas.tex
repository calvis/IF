An important observation about interactive fiction is that rather than
writing {\em rules}, we're really writing {\em exceptions} (in common, not
PL, parlance). For example, we might like to say that the cave is dark,
except when the player carries a light source -- except when the light source
is switched off -- or when the character is on fire... and so on.
