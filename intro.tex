Interactive fiction, or text adventures, is a genre of game in which
players interact in a text loop not unlike a REPL. The game provides a
prompt, the player enters a command, and the game responds with the next
prompt, possibly changing some internal state.

Commonly, the game's state includes a map of a physical space that the
player navigates with directional commands. The space consists of connected
rooms, and within the rooms are objects and characters that the player can
interact with, e.g. by {\em looking} around, {\em examining} something, 
{\em taking} something, or {\em talking} to someone. The player also
typically has an inventory to store taken objects and can apply commands to
those objects.

Interactive fiction is a ripe problem domain for programming languages
because it keeps the focus on game mechanics.
